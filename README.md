# flab

Library for Feature Lab empirics.

For local development:
```
# Run this when starting a new project with uv
uv add "flab @ git+https://github.com/the-feature-lab/flab"
# Run these when the flab repo gets updated -- otherwise uv's local copy doesn't sync.
uv lock --upgrade-package flab
uv sync
```

For colab:
```
!pip install git+https://github.com/the-feature-lab/flab
```

Then the following should work:
```
from flab.empirics import rcsetup
from flab.mupify import mupify
from flab.prismatic.feature_decomp import generate_hea_monomials
# etc
```
